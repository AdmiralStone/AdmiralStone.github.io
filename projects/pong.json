Each player controls a paddle on either end of the screen. The Left paddle can be controlled by W,S keys while the Right paddle is controlled by Up, Down arrow. A player scores a point if the opponent misses to hit the ball and it hits the wall behind his paddle. Once a player scores the ball is positioned at the middle of the screen and the game is restarted. The game can also be manualy restarted by pressing the 'R' key.",
    "learnings":"I got a basic understanding about the Unity Engine by doing the project. I used the Scene Manager to transition from the Menu scene to the Game Scene. I learned how various UI elements such as buttons can be added and used in the Engine.",
